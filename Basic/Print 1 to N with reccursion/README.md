### Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function printNos() that takes N as parameter and prints number from 1 to N recursively. Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.

### Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N) (Recursive).

### Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1000
