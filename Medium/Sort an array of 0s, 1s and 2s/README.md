# Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function sort012() that takes an array arr and N as input parameters and sorts the array in-place.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


# Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^6
0 <= A[i] <= 2
