### Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. The task is to complete the function maxSubarraySum() which takes Arr[] and N as input parameters and returns the sum of subarray with maximum sum.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


### Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
-107 ≤ A[i] ≤ 107
