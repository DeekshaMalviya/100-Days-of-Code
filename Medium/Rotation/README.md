### Your Task:
Complete the function findKRotation() which takes array arr and size n, as input parameters and returns an integer representing the answer. You don't have to print answers or take inputs.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log(n))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

### Constraints:
1 <= n <=105
1 <= arri <= 107
