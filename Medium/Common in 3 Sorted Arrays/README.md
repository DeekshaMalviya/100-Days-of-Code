### Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function commonElements() which take the 3 arrays A[], B[], C[] and their respective sizes n1, n2 and n3 as inputs and returns an array containing the common element present in all the 3 arrays in sorted order. 
If there are no such elements return an empty array. In this case the output will be printed as -1.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n1 + n2 + n3)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n1 + n2 + n3)
