# Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function print2largest() which takes the array of integers arr and n as parameters and returns an integer denoting the answer. If 2nd largest element doesn't exist then return -1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

# Constraints:
2 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Arri ≤ 105
